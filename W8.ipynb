An [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/where-did-trump-make-election-gains-unemployment-data-tells-surprising-n1247935) in NBC claims that \"analysis of unemployment and voting data found that the president’s share of the vote held steady or increased in each of the 20 counties with the highest rise in unemployment from September 2019 to September 2020. And his vote share improved by 1 percentage point or more in 70 of the 100 hardest-hit counties.\" Let's look into this.\n",

This is particularly important if we're interested in investigating the relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour, because of the urban-rural divide. For example, with in the state of New York there are probably vast differences in social and economic factors relevant to voting behaviour between Manhattan and very rural areas; this variation is lost when we look at aggregate state-level resutls, but visible when we look at the county-level. As such, in addition to the datasets we've just imported, we're going to be downloading county-level unemployment data straight from the BLS using the loop below."

This is a code that uniquely identifies states and counties in the U.S. A two digit FIPS code identifies states (e.g. 01: Alabama, 02: Alaska, etc.) and a five digit fips code identifies counties (e.g. 010001: Atauga County, Alabama; 02068: Denali Borough, Alaska). Notice, the first two digits of the five-digit county FIPS code indicates the state. Boring, yes, but these codes are imperative in allowing us to join county- and state- level datasets from different sources quicky and easily.

Lets make a map to explore the spatial distribution of unemployment across time in the U.S. In order to do that, we're going to need a spatial file that tells us the shapes of the counties; I've imported it as a variable called `county_polygons`. We're then going to create an  map using the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) library, which is great for making pretty, interactive maps and plots. It will have a slider on the bottom that lets us view unemployment in different years. It's doing quite a bit under the hood so it will take some time to plot. Be patient."

Of course, random assignment is usually not possible with most survey research. If we want to control for the effect of a variable, we must explicitly measure it. If we don’t measure it, we can’t control for it. In practice, there will almost certainly be some variables we have failed to measure (or have measured poorly), so our models will likely suffer from some degree of omitted variable bias.\n",

With panel data we can control for stable characteristics (i.e. characteristics that do not change across time) whether they are measured or not. These include such things as sex, race, and ethnicity for individuals, or urban/rural, topography, economic structure for geographic areas.

So, given that we have 6 time periods for each county then the six records for county 1 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_1$, the six records for county 2 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_2$, etc. But, $\\epsilon_{it}$ is free to be different for every case at every time period.\n",

Variables whose values do not change (like race or gender) cannot cause changes across time (unless their effects change across time as well).

        "One of the reasons that we observe a signficant relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour in last week's workshop is that the Republican and Democratic parties have opposing views on what to do about unemployment. Democratic lawmakers have historically been in favour of increasing the minimum wage to benefit low-income workers, while Republicans have generally opposed this on the basis that it would hurt these very workers by increase unemployment. Indeed, classical economic theory holds that an increase in wages would lead to a reduction in employment; A business that makes $100k in revenue per year and spends all of it on employing 20 people can't suddenly start paying their workers double their salaries-- unless it fires half of its workers. This is obviously a simplified model though-- minimum wage laws typically don't double wages, and businesses don't operate at-cost, they turn a profit which they could use to pay their workers more.

If you observe a change in the outcome variable in the treatment group after having administered the treatment, you can interpert that as the causal effect of treatment. This is because we're able to make a plausible argument that the **control group can act as a counterfactual (a stand-in) for the treatment group in the absence of treatment**. Both groups had the same values before the treatment, then the only thing that changed between them was the treatment, so if we observe a change in the outcome variable, it must be due to treatment.\n",

So we get 12 consecutive values of minimum wage every year. The reason that the staircases are descending is because these minimum wages are adjusted for inflation. No matter where you're from, you've probably heard a grandparent say something along the lines of \"My parents would send me to the shops with 25 cents to buy groceries for the week\", but now it costs £9 for a bag of chips.
